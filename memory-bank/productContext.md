# Product Context: Nuke Family Helper Script

## Why This Project Exists

The Nuke Family Helper Script was created to address specific challenges faced by leadership and members of the "Nuke Family" faction in the online game Torn. In Torn, factions (guilds/clans) require significant coordination and management, especially for larger and more organized groups like the Nuke Family.

Without specialized tools, faction leaders must manually:

- Track problematic players and factions (the "shitlist")
- Calculate and distribute rewards/payouts to members
- Monitor contract compliance and requirements
- Communicate important information to members

These manual processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and can lead to inconsistent experiences. The Nuke Family Helper Script automates and streamlines these processes, allowing faction leadership to focus on strategy and member engagement rather than administrative tasks.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Shitlist Management

- **Problem**: Keeping track of problematic players or factions requires external spreadsheets or documents
- **Solution**: Integrated shitlist that displays directly on player/faction profiles with categorization and reason tracking

### 2. Payout Distribution

- **Problem**: Calculating and distributing rewards to members is tedious and error-prone
- **Solution**: Automated payout suggestions based on member contributions, with streamlined interfaces for both cash and item (Xanax) distribution

### 3. Contract Visibility

- **Problem**: Contract terms and requirements are not easily visible to members
- **Solution**: Display active contracts and their requirements directly on relevant pages

### 4. Authentication Complexity

- **Problem**: Securing faction tools while making them accessible to authorized members
- **Solution**: Integration with Nuke.Family API for secure authentication and role-based access

## How It Should Work

The script should function as a seamless extension of the Torn game interface, adding new functionality without disrupting the core game experience. Key principles include:

1. **Non-intrusive Integration**: The script should add functionality to existing pages rather than creating entirely new interfaces
2. **Consistent Styling**: Visual elements should match the game's aesthetic to maintain immersion
3. **Performance Efficiency**: The script should load quickly and not impact game performance
4. **Graceful Degradation**: If parts of the script fail (e.g., API connection issues), the core game should remain functional
5. **Clear Feedback**: Users should receive clear indications when actions succeed or fail

The workflow should be intuitive, with minimal training required for users to understand and utilize the features. For example:

- Shitlist entries should be visible at a glance on player profiles
- Payout processes should guide users through each step with clear instructions
- Contract information should be prominently displayed where relevant

## User Experience Goals

### For Faction Leadership

- Reduce administrative burden by automating routine tasks
- Provide clear visibility into faction operations and member activities
- Enable more informed decision-making through better information access
- Streamline communication of important information to members

### For Faction Members

- Improve understanding of faction rules and expectations
- Provide transparency into payout processes and rewards
- Offer clear guidance on contract requirements and compliance
- Create a more cohesive faction experience

### For All Users

- Maintain a consistent visual experience that complements the game
- Ensure reliable performance without disrupting gameplay
- Provide clear feedback for all actions
- Respect user privacy and security

The ultimate goal is to enhance the Torn experience for Nuke Family members by reducing administrative friction and improving information flow, allowing the faction to operate more efficiently and focus on enjoyable aspects of the game.
