## Current Status

The Nuke Family Helper Script is currently in a stable and functional state with version 2.6.0. The core features are working reliably, and the script is being actively used by Nuke Family faction members. Development is ongoing with a focus on bug fixes and incremental improvements.

### Development Status

- **Active Development**: Yes
- **Current Version**: 2.6.0
- **Stability**: Good, with occasional minor issues
- **User Adoption**: High among faction leadership, growing among regular members
- **Maintenance Level**: Regular updates and bug fixes

### Recent Milestones

- Completed contract management system
- Enhanced shitlist with support for friendly entries
- Improved Xanax distribution workflow
- Added more robust error handling

## Known Issues

### Bugs and Limitations

1. **Shitlist Display Issues**

   - Occasionally fails to display on certain profiles due to DOM structure variations
   - Some categories may not display correctly if they contain special characters
   - Pending approval status sometimes doesn't update without a page refresh

2. **Payout System Limitations**

   - Cannot handle very large payout amounts (over 1 billion) correctly
   - Xanax distribution occasionally loses track of remaining payouts if browser is closed mid-process
   - No confirmation when a payout is completed, requiring manual verification

3. **Contract Display Problems**

   - Contract details may overlap with other UI elements on some screen sizes
   - Premium contract indicator sometimes doesn't appear correctly
   - End date display can be confusing for contracts without a specified end date

4. **Technical Issues**
   - Caching system can sometimes retain stale data longer than intended
   - API token validation doesn't always detect expired tokens immediately
   - Update checker occasionally prompts for updates when already on the latest version

### Workarounds

- For shitlist display issues: Refreshing the page usually resolves the problem
- For payout tracking: Keep a manual record of completed payouts as a backup
- For contract display: Adjusting browser zoom can help with overlap issues
- For caching problems: Manual clearing of browser cache or localStorage can reset the system

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach (v1.0 - v1.5)

The project began with a focus on basic shitlist functionality, with a simple display of entries on player profiles. Key decisions during this phase:

- **Userscript Implementation**: Chose to implement as a userscript for easy distribution and installation
- **Direct DOM Manipulation**: Used straightforward DOM manipulation for UI elements
- **Simple Storage**: Relied on localStorage for data persistence
- **Minimal API Integration**: Limited API calls to essential data retrieval

### Expansion Phase (v1.6 - v2.0)

As the script gained adoption, the scope expanded to include payout management and more advanced features:

- **Enhanced API Integration**: Developed more comprehensive API communication
- **Caching System**: Implemented a time-based caching system to reduce API load
- **Role-Based Access**: Added support for different user roles with appropriate permissions
- **Improved UI**: Enhanced the visual design to better match the Torn interface

### Refinement Phase (v2.1 - v2.5)

With core functionality in place, focus shifted to reliability and user experience:

- **Error Handling**: Implemented more robust error handling throughout the script
- **Observer Pattern**: Adopted MutationObserver for more reliable DOM integration
- **Update Mechanism**: Created a version checking system for updates
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved performance through more efficient code

### Current Direction (v2.6+)

The current development direction emphasizes stability, extensibility, and user experience:

- **Modular Design**: Moving toward a more modular architecture for better maintainability
- **Enhanced Caching**: Refining the caching system for better performance and reliability
- **User Feedback**: Incorporating more user feedback into feature prioritization
- **Documentation**: Improving both code documentation and user guidance

### Lessons Applied

Throughout the project's evolution, several key lessons have been applied:

1. **Incremental Development**: Smaller, more frequent updates have proven more successful than large overhauls
2. **User-Centered Design**: Features driven by user needs have seen higher adoption
3. **Technical Debt Management**: Regular refactoring has helped maintain code quality
4. **Compatibility Focus**: Ensuring compatibility with the Torn interface has been critical for reliability

These lessons continue to guide development decisions, with a balance between new features, stability improvements, and technical refinements.
