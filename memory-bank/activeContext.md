## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **API Communication Strategy**

   - Currently using direct API calls with caching
   - Considering implementing a more robust retry mechanism for failed requests
   - Evaluating the balance between fresh data and reduced API load

2. **DOM Manipulation Approach**

   - Using a combination of direct DOM manipulation and jQuery when available
   - Considering a more consistent approach to reduce complexity
   - Evaluating the impact of Torn UI changes on injection points

3. **Storage Strategy**
   - Currently using a mix of localStorage and GM_setValue/GM_getValue
   - Considering a more unified approach to storage
   - Evaluating options for handling larger datasets

### User Experience Considerations

1. **Visual Design**

   - Maintaining consistency with the Torn game interface
   - Balancing information density with clarity
   - Ensuring accessibility for users with different needs

2. **Feature Discoverability**

   - Ensuring users can easily find and understand available features
   - Considering adding tooltips or help text for complex functionality
   - Evaluating the need for a more comprehensive onboarding experience

3. **Error Handling**
   - Providing clear and actionable error messages
   - Balancing verbose logging for troubleshooting with clean user experience
   - Implementing graceful degradation when features cannot function

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

1. **Function Naming**

   - Descriptive function names that indicate purpose
   - Prefix patterns for related functions (e.g., `build*` for UI construction)
   - Consistent casing (camelCase for functions and variables)

2. **Module Structure**

   - IIFE for script encapsulation
   - Logical grouping of related functions
   - Clear separation of concerns between components

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try/catch blocks for critical operations
   - Fallback values for potentially missing data
   - User-friendly error messages with logging for debugging

### UI Patterns

1. **Component Structure**

   - Consistent container hierarchy for injected elements
   - Standard class naming convention with `nfh-` prefix
   - Reusable builder functions for common UI elements

2. **Visual Styling**

   - Dark theme to match Torn's interface
   - Consistent spacing and padding
   - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct section headers

3. **User Interaction**
   - Confirmation for destructive actions
   - Clear feedback for successful operations
   - Intuitive form layouts for data entry

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights

1. **DOM Manipulation Challenges**

   - The dynamic nature of the Torn interface requires careful observation and timing
   - MutationObserver has proven essential for reliable content injection
   - Selector specificity is crucial for targeting the correct elements

2. **API Integration Lessons**

   - Caching is essential for performance and reducing API load
   - Error handling must account for network issues and API changes
   - Authentication token management requires careful security considerations

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Different browsers handle userscript permissions differently
   - Storage mechanisms have varying limitations across browsers
   - CSS compatibility requires testing across different environments

### Project Management Insights

1. **Feature Prioritization**

   - User feedback has been valuable for identifying high-impact improvements
   - Balancing new features with stability and performance is an ongoing challenge
   - Small, incremental improvements have been more successful than large overhauls

2. **Documentation Importance**

   - Clear code comments have proven essential for maintenance
